## Description of Our Project

We develop an app to keep track of all the known squirrels and start with Central Park. In the **sightings** app, we show a
view that lists all squirrel sightings. By clicking the link on their unique id, you can see each squirrel's information and 
update them. There is also an add link at the beginning of the webpage which helps you to add a new sighting. In addition, 
we count some data about squirrels and present them in tables and charts. In the **map** app, we display the location 
of the squirrel sightings on an OpenStreets map.
